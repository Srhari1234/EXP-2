# EXP-2
Aim: To study and implement C++ data structures.

Theory: The unary operator "sizeof" determines the size of data types such as variables and constants. The sizes of data types are usually the same in all cases, such as ints, which are always 4 bytes. In the first code, we determine the size of character, int, float, short int, long int, bool, and long double. In the second code, it is user-defined. The user enters an integer, float, short int, or long int, and the program calculates its size. In the third code, we use the storage classes auto and register. However, there are four storage classes in C++. They are: auto, extern, register, static, and mutable. The auto class defaults to the global variable. Registers defy local variables and have max size as the register size. Static is not user-defined because it only takes one value. extern uses global files that are visible to all programs.
