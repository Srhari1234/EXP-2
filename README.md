# EXP-2
AIM: To study and implement C++ data structures.

THEORY:

The sizeof operator in C++ returns the size (in bytes) of a variable or data type. This operator is evaluated at compile time and provides information about the memory allocated for each data type.

a.sizeof(char): Typically returns 1 byte, as the size of char is defined to be 1 byte in C++.

b.sizeof(int): The size of int is system-dependent but usually 4 bytes on most modern systems.

c.sizeof(short int): Usually 2 bytes, though this can vary depending on the system.

d.sizeof(long int): Often 4 or 8 bytes, depending on the system architecture (e.g., 4 bytes on 32 bit systems and 8 bytes on 64-bit systems).

e.sizeof(float): Generally 4 bytes.

f.sizeof(double): Typically 8 bytes.

g.sizeof(long double): Can vary but is often 12 or 16 bytes.

h.sizeof(bool): Often 1 byte, though this can vary.
